## Challenges of BIG DATA
- Research procedures that are routine for small experimental datasets are close to impossible in large datasets
- These datasets present remarkable opportunities to harness data-driven methods, such as machine learning algorithms, to study the brain basis of individual differences, but care needs to be taken so that these methods are not led astray by confounding information or become too opaque to provide useful information.
-  We have addressed this by creating tightly-matched sub-samples from large datasets, and by harnessing
interpretable machine learning methods.



<!--
Thanks to advances in data collection technologies, and in the technologies to store and compute on
data, and thanks to sociotechnical trends towards increased reproducibility and transparency,
researchers in many fields are increasingly gaining access to large, diverse and complex datasets.
Through a range of centralized data collection efforts, researchers in neuroscience are now also able
to access datasets of unprecedented size and diversity. But the question is: what should we do with
these datasets to maximize their utility? What do these datasets enable that was not possible with
smaller focused studies? This talk will discuss a few of the challenges that large neuroscience
datasets present and discuss some of their promise. The talk will revolve around a set of open-source
software tools that we developed for data-driven analysis of major brain white matter pathways. The
tools that we have developed address a range of issues: research procedures that are routine for small
experimental datasets are close to impossible in large datasets, and we have developed scalable
computing tools, as well as tools that crowd-source research procedures. These datasets present
remarkable opportunities to harness data-driven methods, such as machine learning algorithms, to
study the brain basis of individual differences, but care needs to be taken so that these methods are
not led astray by confounding information or become too opaque to provide useful information. We
have addressed this by creating tightly-matched sub-samples from large datasets, and by harnessing
interpretable machine learning methods. Finally, I will discuss the challenges of training the next
generation of researchers to judiciously combine neuroscience knowledge with data science
methods. I will focus on the NeuroHackademy summer institute for neuroimaging and data science
that we have established in order to provide such training.
